##how to chang color :
You can specify any color in CSS in one of three ways:
1- rgb values These express colors in terms of how much red, green and blue are used to make it up. For example: rgb(100,100,90)

2- hex Codes These are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red, green and blue in a color, preceded by a pound or hash # sign. For example: #ee3e80
3- Color names There are 147 predefined color names that are recognized by browsers. For example: DarkCyan

##css3:
CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to  X indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.
CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values,  X with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.
